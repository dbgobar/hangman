# Rubric

## Deployment
Performing - App is deployed and is congruent on gh-pages with local copy

## Technical Requirements
Performing - App meets all technical requirements of the project! Great work. How can we refactor this code base further? Or take a more object oriented approach?

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is properly indented and I LOVE the comments you've made. They clearly outline what your code is doing.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing - What a great theme! The marshmallows were definitely a great touch. It'd be cool to implement a timer of sorts.
